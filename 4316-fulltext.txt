We thought Miley Cyrus' MTV VMAs drama felt familiar. The 21-year-old singer has recruited Madonna for her "MTV Unplugged" special, and the star admits that she takes some inspirational cues from Madonna. "I grew up listening to Madonna, and a lot of what she represented for me is what I try to represent to girls now, not being afraid of sexuality and being who you want to be and doing what you want to do," Cyrus told MTV, which will air her "Unplugged" special tonight at 9 p.m. ET/PT. During Cyrus' set, the two pop stars collaborate on a mashup of Madge's "Don't Tell Me" and Cyrus' No. 1 hit, "We Can't Stop." According to MTV, we can expect plenty of Madonna-on-Miley grinding - which, given her reason for having Madonna on in the first place, makes sense. "'Don't Tell Me' is basically the same message that I'm telling my fans with 'We Can't Stop,'" Cyrus said. "I feel like 'We Can't Stop' is the 2013 version of 'Don't Tell Me.' ... She understood why that was important for a lot of our fans, especially those that are young, who are trying to figure out their freedom. I really wanted her here because I wanted that energy ... she's so about making a statement." To refresh your memories, we've dropped both music videos below - do you think Cyrus has a point?

'Duck Dynasty's' Willie Robertson soundoff (6 Responses) B Oh please Miley February 10, 2014 at 9:00 pm | Report abuse | Log in to Reply undisputed420champ I am a 28 year old male and somehow in the last 4-5 years I must have become completely out of touch with music and pop culture. I watch that Madonna video (which I know is a far departure from her earlier videos), which I remember from my youth, and it sounds like music and while simple the video caught my attention. Then i start the Miley video and NOTHING makes sense to me, the music sucks (i know, my opinion) and the video is just plain strange. I just don't understand the mindset of the Mileys, Beibers, etc. They just seem so lost and out of touch with reality. But again, maybe its just me.

I know people have different styles but seriously she doesn't even look good. Not flattering at all. I was around when Britney and Christina were going through their "odd" stages and I thought (and still think) they looked hot. Oh and keep your tongue in your mouth, not attractive at all.

I am not so sure I would like to see teenagers or young women pull their tongues and twerk at men like you do, it is so vulgar and low, it makes you want to throw up; at least, Madonna had singing talent.

'Duck Dynasty's' Willie Robertson At President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, it was "Duck Dynasty's" Willie Robertson who was the man of the hour for some politicians. As the reality star made his way through the Washington, D.C. crowd along with his wife, Korie, congressional leaders leaped at the chance for a photo op with the son of controversial "Dynasty" patriarch, Phil Robertson. Willie was there as a guest of Louisiana Rep. Vance McAllister, who called the TV star and chief executive of his family's Duck Commander business a "close friend (and) constituent." With my special guest @williebosshog and his wife @bosshogswife before the #SOTU pic.twitter.com/0EYYSV0XAT — Vance McAllister (@RepMcAllister) January 29, 2014 According to The Hollywood Reporter, Phil Robertson's support of McAllister's campaign has been credited as helping the representative to win his seat. Yet while McAllister could claim the "Duck Dynasty" star as his special guest for the evening, he had to share him with his colleagues. Several congressional leaders couldn't resist tweeting out photos taken with Robertson.

I stand with Duck Dynasty! Chatted with Willie Robertson today. @williebosshog pic.twitter.com/XiD6RdI3NH — Rep. Steve Stockman (@SteveWorks4You) January 28, 2014 As far as what Robertson considered the highlight of Obama's speech, it sounds like it wasn't gun control. Tweeted political writer Alex Pappas: Asked Duck Dynasty's Willie Robertson about Obama's vow to enact gun control. "I think I missed that," he replied.

View AWS Free Tier Details » Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a simple web-services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers. Featured Customers Read the Story » Watch the Video » Watch the Video » Read the Story » Watch the Video » Use Cases Content Storage and Distribution Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and available store for a variety of content, ranging from web applications to media files. It allows you to offload your entire storage infrastructure onto the cloud, where you can take advantage of Amazon S3’s scalability and pay-as-you-go pricing to handle your growing storage needs. You can distribute your content directly from Amazon S3 or use Amazon S3 as an origin store for pushing content to your Amazon CloudFront edge locations. For sharing content that is either easily reproduced or where you’re storing an original copy elsewhere, Amazon S3’s Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) feature provides a compelling solution. For example, if you’re storing media content in-house but you need to provide accessibility to your customers, channel partners, or employees, RRS is a low-cost solution for storing and sharing this content. Storage for Data Analysis Whether you’re storing pharmaceutical data for analysis, financial data for computation and pricing, or photo images for resizing, Amazon S3 is an ideal location to store your original content. You can then send this content to Amazon EC2 for computation, resizing, or other large scale analytics – without incurring any data transfer charges for moving the data between the services. You can then choose to store the resulting, reproducible content using Amazon S3’s Reduced Redundancy Storage feature (or, of course, you can store it using Amazon S3’s standard storage as well). Backup, Archiving and Disaster Recovery Amazon S3 offers a highly durable, scalable, and secure solution for backing up and archiving your critical data. You can use Amazon S3’s Versioning capability to provide even further protection for your stored data. If you have data sets of significant size, you can use AWS Import/Export to move large amounts of data into and out of AWS with physical storage devices. This is ideal for moving large quantities of data for periodic backups, or quickly retrieving data for disaster recovery scenarios. You can also define rules to archive sets of Amazon S3 objects to Amazon Glacier’s extremely low-cost storage service based on object lifetimes. As your data ages, these rules enable you to ensure that it’s automatically stored on the storage option that is most cost-effective for your needs. Learn more » Static Website Hosting You can host your entire static website on Amazon S3 for an inexpensive, highly available hosting solution that scales automatically to meet traffic demands. Self-hosting a highly available website that can handle peak traffic loads can be challenging and costly. With Amazon S3, you can reliably serve your traffic and handle unexpected peaks without worrying about scaling your infrastructure. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.99% availability and 99.999999999% durability, and it gives you access to the same highly scalable, reliable, and fast infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. You also benefit from pay-as-you-go pricing. You pay only for the capacity you use. Amazon S3’s website hosting solution is ideal for websites with static content, including html files, images, videos, and client-side scripts such as JavaScript. (Amazon EC2 is recommended for websites with server-side scripting and database interaction). Amazon S3 Design Requirements Amazon S3 is based on the idea that quality Internet-based storage should be taken for granted. It helps free developers from worrying about how they will store their data, whether it will be safe and secure, or whether they will have enough storage available. It frees them from the upfront costs of setting up their own storage solution as well as the ongoing costs of maintaining and scaling their storage servers. The functionality of Amazon S3 is simple and robust: Store any amount of data inexpensively and securely, while ensuring that the data will always be available when you need it. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it. Amazon S3 was built to fulfill the following design requirements: Secure Built to provide infrastructure that allows the customer to maintain full control over who has access to their data. Customers must also be able to easily secure their data in transit and at rest. Reliable Store data with up to 99.999999999% durability, with 99.99% availability. There can be no single points of failure. All failures must be tolerated or repaired by the system without any downtime. Scalable Amazon S3 can scale in terms of storage, request rate, and users to support an unlimited number of web-scale applications. It uses scale as an advantage: Adding nodes to the system increases, not decreases, its availability, speed, throughput, capacity, and robustness. Fast Amazon S3 must be fast enough to support high-performance applications. Server-side latency must be insignificant relative to Internet latency. Any performance bottlenecks can be fixed by simply adding nodes to the system. Inexpensive Amazon S3 is built from inexpensive commodity hardware components. All hardware will eventually fail and this must not affect the overall system. It must be hardware-agnostic, so that savings can be captured as Amazon continues to drive down infrastructure costs. Simple Building highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive storage is difficult. Doing so in a way that makes it easy to use for any application anywhere is more difficult. Amazon S3 must do both. A forcing-function for the design was that a single Amazon S3 distributed system must support the needs of both internal Amazon applications and external developers of any application. This means that it must be fast and reliable enough to run Amazon.com’s websites, while flexible enough that any developer can use it for any data storage need.

The actor, who's currently promoting his movie "The Monuments Men," took part in the discussion from the set of his upcoming project, "Tomorrowland." Here are three things we learned: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler need to watch their backs. George Clooney wasn't at the Golden Globe awards earlier this month, but he definitely heard about Fey's wisecrack. The former "SNL"-er joked that Clooney's "Gravity" was really about Clooney preferring to float off into space and die than spend another minute with a woman his own age. He's said once before that the comedic duo have poked a bear, and he extended his warning during his AMA. "I got really good by Tina and Amy the other day, and I’m working on getting them back in a big way," Clooney said. Sandra Bullock's a lush: When it comes to nailing down his favorite moment on the set of "Gravity," he jokes that "it’s tricky 'cause Sandy [Bullock] drinks so much that oftentimes it’s just hard to keep her upright." But in seriousness, he and Bullock have known each other for more than 20 years, and they have the friendship to prove it. "We both were struggling actors when we first met. She was dating a friend of mine at the time who’s still a good friend of ours. Every time we’re together it’s funny. She’s somebody I adore, really, she’s just fun to be in a room with. I’m sure people will assume people aren’t quite who they appear to be on screen–they’re shorter or taller or meaner or dumber–but Sandy is exactly what she appears on screen, an incredibly charming woman who’s really just fun to hang out with. Very smart and centered, even though she does drink a lot." He's doing a lot of wire work for 2015's "Tomorrowland." Clooney declined to say too much about "Tomorrowland," a sci-fi mystery about two teens who set off to uncover a place in time and space that they both have memories of, but he emphasized repeatedly that he's pretty much always strapped into a harness. "I'm on set and literally have a harness on right now. I was late, because right before I was hanging from about 30 feet over four different blue screens," Clooney said. "So as we’re talking now there are all these wires and contraptions hanging off of me. It’s really, really, really good and Brad [Bird]'s a wonderful director, and a wonderful guy with a wild imagination. And if I don’t screw it up it’ll be a terrific film. Everybody’s really good in it. Anyway, you always have to be careful what you say about these films so I don’t want to sort of ruin it by telling you that everyone dies in the end. Oops, I've said too much.

We thought Miley Cyrus' MTV VMAs drama felt familiar. The 21-year-old singer has recruited Madonna for her "MTV Unplugged" special, and the star admits that she takes some inspirational cues from Madonna. "I grew up listening to Madonna, and a lot of what she represented for me is what I try to represent to girls now, not being afraid of sexuality and being who you want to be and doing what you want to do," Cyrus told MTV, which will air her "Unplugged" special tonight at 9 p.m. ET/PT. During Cyrus' set, the two pop stars collaborate on a mashup of Madge's "Don't Tell Me" and Cyrus' No. 1 hit, "We Can't Stop." According to MTV, we can expect plenty of Madonna-on-Miley grinding - which, given her reason for having Madonna on in the first place, makes sense. "'Don't Tell Me' is basically the same message that I'm telling my fans with 'We Can't Stop,'" Cyrus said. "I feel like 'We Can't Stop' is the 2013 version of 'Don't Tell Me.' ... She understood why that was important for a lot of our fans, especially those that are young, who are trying to figure out their freedom. I really wanted her here because I wanted that energy ... she's so about making a statement." To refresh your memories, we've dropped both music videos below - do you think Cyrus has a point?

I watch that Madonna video (which I know is a far departure from her earlier videos), which I remember from my youth, and it sounds like music and while simple the video caught my attention. Then i start the Miley video and NOTHING makes sense to me, the music sucks (i know, my opinion) and the video is just plain strange. I just don't understand the mindset of the Mileys, Beibers, etc. They just seem so lost and out of touch with reality. But again, maybe its just me.

I know people have different styles but seriously she doesn't even look good. Not flattering at all. I was around when Britney and Christina were going through their "odd" stages and I thought (and still think) they looked hot. Oh and keep your tongue in your mouth, not attractive at all.

ElBaradei touched down in Cairo Friday evening for the first time since leaving his post as head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Association after 12 years in office. Supporters hope to use the publicity to boost speculation about his potential candidacy for 2011 elections. Egypt has been ruled for nearly 30 years by Hosni Mubarak, who appears to be trying to set up a political dynasty by grooming his son to succeed him. Respected worldwide and untouched by the corruption tainting much of Egypt's current regime, ElBaradei, who won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, could be the most credible opposition leader to emerge as this U.S.-allied country prepares for 2011 presidential elections. And many Egyptians hope ElBaradei's international standing will make it difficult for the current government to persecute him for trying to bring reform to the country. The crowd at the airport – made up of actors, intellectuals, opposition leaders, and regular Egyptians – broke into loud applause when word of ElBaradei's arrival spread, and then sang the Egyptian national anthem. Many supporters carried large posters with ElBaradei's face and the word "YES!" signifying their desire to see him run for president. Bloggers and activists followed his arrival with a live stream on the Internet of what was happening on the ground at the airport. ElBaradei tried to leave the VIP lounge at the airport shortly after his arrival, but the sheer size of the crowd blocked the exit of the lounge and prevented him. He was briefly glimpsed getting into a car and driving off, waving to his supporters through the car window. Despite the enthusiasm his return has sparked among many Egyptians hungry for change, ElBaradei has been guarded about a potential presidential run. In an open letter responding to an effort by young Egyptians urging him to run for president, he said he would only join the race if guaranteed that elections would be free, fully supervised by the judiciary and monitored by the international community. He also wants the constitution amended to remove restrictions on who is eligible to run.

(20140127,thevoiceofreason10.tumblr.com,http://thevoiceofreason10.tumblr.com/post/4501273644/hobbes-or-locke-an-egyptian-revolution,The Voice of Reason - Hobbes or Locke: An Egyptian Revolution The Voice of Reason Apr 10 Hobbes or Locke: An Egyptian Revolution After the uprising in Tunisia in December 2010 and the expulsion of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011 after 23 years in power, tensions in Egypt began to mount towards the end of January. This tension originated from the actions of the Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt since 1981: a fraudulent election in December 2010 in which Mubarak was once again declared the winner, and Mubarak’s clear intensions to pass on power to his son led to the eruption of protests in Cairo on January 25th, only eleven days after the protests in Tunisia. After 30 years in power, on February 11th, after 18 days of protest, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to his newly instated vice-president. In this act, Mubarak’s rule over Egypt was ended, and a new democratic system was instated that ended the reign of tyranny over Egypt. Or so the media would have you think. However, the route cause of this ‘revolution’ needs to be examined in order to determine whether the ousting of Mubarak was an example of Thomas Hobbes’s state, or a John Locke state, as the implications of this will be far reaching, and imperative to the future of Egypt. Whether or not this was an example of Hobbes or Locke is determined by one’s view of the true nature of humans. In this grassroots project, encouraged by the use of social media caused video blogs to go viral at a time when emotions were highly charged in Egypt. The accessibility of these videos led to the protests in Tahrir square, where tens of thousands protested for the removal of Mubarak as president. This is a clear example of the state of nature that Hobbes described in his Leviathan, as “all mankind [has] a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceases only in death”. The actions exhibited by the Egyptian people are a clear example of this, at the beginning of the eighteen days, they were not demanding the resignation of Mubarak, but of the Interior Minister. It was only once Mubarak changed his cabinet on January 28th that the people realized the power they had, and decided to go for more. In that politically and emotionally charged environment, they reverted back to their natural state, seeking only one power after another, until February 18th when Mubarak resigned and they had no one left to target. Or so the Hobbes perspective would have you believe. However, if you look at the manner in which the revolution came about, it is clear that this is an example of Locke. The protesters revolted against five main issues: unfair elections and lack of freedom of speech, passing on of Mubarak’s power to his son, police brutality, state of emergency laws and economic issues (including high unemployment, food price inflation and low minimum wages). This is a clear example of the State of Nature, along with the Law of Nature that governs it that was described in Two Treaties of Government; “Law teaches all Mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his Life, Health, Liberty or Possessions.” This is what the Egyptian revolution was based on, as they demanded the government to uphold their freedoms and equality, and when that failed, they instituted their right to revolution and ousted their president. So if it is accepted that Egypt is an example of a Locke’s world, what is the implication of that on Canada? In their statement on Canada’s role in Egypt, the government stated that “Egypt remains an important partner for Canada, and we urge the Egyptian government to ensure full freedom of political expression for its citizens.” [1] Although at first glance it appears that the Canadian government is exhibiting a Locke standpoint, it is clearly a Hobbes agenda. This emphasis on a Hobbes state comes from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; the first point of the Charter states that “the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” This is a very realist view exhibited by Hobbes. According to Locke, rights and freedoms are inalienable and can never be denied to a citizen of a country. The rights are not subject to ‘reasonable limits’ that can thus be denied when it suits someone. Thus, it is not only the basis that the government is acting on, but also the actions of the government itself that uses the rhetoric of liberalism, but is in fact realist. In this way, the government feels that they have no responsibility to the people of Egypt who are trying to conduct a revolution, and thus act accordingly. I believe that it is the right and responsibility of the Canadian government to aid the people of Egypt in this clear example of the right to revolution described by Locke. Ultimately, if this were an example of a ‘Hobbesian’ world, the Egyptian people would have submitted themselves to a new power in order to maintain the peace. However, they were under the rule of a dictator for thirty years who was difficult to challenge, yet they still revolted. In this ‘Lockean’ world, it is clear that people are just exercising their right to revolution at a time when they are being suppressed by their government, as “Tyranny is the exercise of Power beyond Right.” Thus, they have exercised their right, and have ousted Mubarak. As of yet, it has been a month since the removal of Mubarak as leader of the country, and a lot has yet to be seen as to the fate of Egypt. However, one thing has been made clear: if another leader of Egypt dares to treat the Egyptians in the same way as Mubarak, they should watch out as the people know how to institute their right to revolution.

(Tarek Fawzy / AP Photo),Tarek Fawzy Mike Giglio facebook tweet post 01.22.11 "We Are All Khaled Said": Will the Revolution Come to Egypt? Tunisia’s uprising last week invigorated frustrated activists around the region. Mike Giglio on a protest in Cairo that could mark the beginning of another upheaval. Khaled Said, a small businessman in the historic Egyptian city of Alexandria, was dragged from an Internet café by police and beaten to death in the street last summer. Said wasn’t known as a political type. But according to human-rights groups, the attack was retaliation for the decision to post a video of cops divvying up drugs from a bust on his personal blog.   The murder clearly struck a nerve. Egyptian activists have waged a longstanding campaign against police brutality and torture, mostly outside the mainstream, and many were surprised by how quickly the news spread among regular folk. “The thing is, he wasn’t really a threat,” says Sherif Mansour, a senior program officer who focuses on new media in Egypt for Freedom House, a watchdog group. “His death made the connection between the advocacy and the everyday life of Egyptians. It made the point that everyone can be affected.”   Shortly after the murder, a Facebook page appeared under the name “ We Are All Khaled Said.” Run by an obsessively anonymous administrator, it started with posts about Said’s case. But the page quickly spiraled into an all-out campaign against police brutality and rights abuses in Egypt—becoming a clearinghouse for information, posting often-graphic photo and video, and publishing the names of allegedly abusive cops. Mansour credits the page with turning police brutality into a popular debate. The group has organized demonstrations in honor of Said, and today its membership is approaching 380,000, which makes it the country’s largest and most active online human-rights activist group.   Now, the group has set its sights on a much bigger cause—taking on authoritarian rule in Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak has been in power for nearly 30 years.   “We’re hoping a lot of people turn up, and that people in the street see us, connect with our demands and join us,” said the leader of a major cyberactivist group. After protesters in Tunisia ousted their country’s autocratic president a week ago, “We Are All Khaled Said” shifted gears to an aggressive political tone. Within days, the page began sounding the call for a large-scale demonstration in Cairo this Tuesday, January 25, with demands ranging from ending police brutality and a $180 minimum wage, to dissolving parliament. The page’s administrator, who insisted on speaking via Gmail chat and asked to be cited as ‘ElShaheeed,” tells Newsweek that events in Tunisia have made people in Egypt take note. “It just provided all of us with hope that things can change,” he says. As of Friday morning, nearly 69,000 people had signed on to the Jan. 25 protest on the “We Are All Khaled Said” Facebook page.   • Babak Dehghanpisheh: Tunisians Revel in ChangeTraditional opposition groups have also started to join the call for protest on Tuesday. Mohamed ElBaradei, a key opposition figure who had warned of a “Tunisia-style explosion” in Egypt, just stopped short of backing the demonstration. On Thursday night, he finally offered tacit support, if only via Twitter: “Fully support call 4 peaceful demonstrations vs. repression,” he tweeted. And so, clues to how Tunisia’s revolution might affect the region’s other autocratic regimes might be found in Cairo next week, especially since cyberactivists and traditional ones alike seem to be joining forces. Tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious or not.  Opposition to Mubarak has been brewing for some time, but only disjointedly. Protests have come and gone, and plans for large-scale demonstrations often fizzle. The Egyptian police state, meanwhile, can be brutally effective at crushing dissent. And in the aftermath of Tunisia, the government is playing close attention; it has unleashed a wave of positive propaganda and released political prisoners.   But following November’s especially contentious parliamentary elections—where the ruling party won an improbable 97 percent of the seats amid accusations of massive vote-rigging—the forces for change had already been agitating, notes Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who left for Cairo today. A smaller rally against police brutality had already been in the works for January 25, a national holiday in honor of police. But the events in Tunisia could give these forces a substantial push. “Tunisia is not causing these things. But it’s certainly adding momentum to the pretty significant opposition that already exists,” Cook says.   Ahmed Salah, a veteran activist in Cairo, points out that the Tunisia revolution happened spontaneously, prompted by the self-immolation of an unemployed university graduate—not at the direction of a political movement or concerted protest push. Yet Salah says the recent spate of copycats across Egypt (there have been nine so far this week) show that agitation is in the air—and crucially, they’ve been regular Egyptians, not activist types.   Activists are trying to capitalize by bringing news of the protest to regular Egyptians however they can, from passing out flyers on the street to word-of-mouth and text messages. Social media has been another tool—and a crucial one—both in coordinating among activists and in spreading the word, particularly because Egyptian media is so tightly controlled. “I don’t know how we could do without it under the current circumstances,” he says. “Before, it was so much more difficult to reach out.”   Despite all the buzz building up to the January 25 protest, however, ElShaheeed is well aware of the difficulties in translating Internet clicks to support on the ground. To that end, he has been using the page to urge people to organize by traditional means as well, even posting links to flyers to be downloaded and distributed—today, activists distributed leaflets to people coming out of Friday prayers. But he says only Tuesday will tell whether these efforts have been enough.   “We’re hoping a lot of people turn up, and that people in the street see us, connect with our demands and join us,” he says. And if the effort fails, “I’d learn from the lesson, move forward and do something else.” Mike Giglio is a reporter at Newsweek. share tweet post email  comments Stories We Like Esquire Parks and Recreation: The Screencap RecapJohn Boehner: Dad, Gestapo, Diner LoverAll of Your Favorite Mean Republicans Are Now Warm and Fuzzy US Weekly Paula Patton, Chrissy Teigen Flaunt Major Cleavage With H...Jessica Simpson Shares Precious Photos of Maxwell, Ace, E...Queen Latifah to Officiate 34 Weddings During Macklemore ...

Alaa Bayoumi Last Modified: 27 Jan 2011 15:08 GMT Email Article Print Article Share Article Send Feedback ElBaradei, Nobel Prize for Peace winner and former IAEA chief, is seen as a decent alternative to the current Egyptian regime that is in place [EPA] The return of Mohamed ElBaradei to Egypt a year ago and him joining the ranks of its political opposition created lots of expectations and frustration. He has been seen as an agent for democracy, hope and change in a country ruled by dictatorships for decades. Yet, many feel he may have wasted an opportunity and failed many Egyptians who believed in him. Thus, when he announced yesterday that he is returning to Egypt from a trip to Europe to join the ongoing and unprecedented protests against the ruling regime, his announcement was met with initial scepticism. Some of the activists who have been participating in the latest protests in the street and online have sharply criticised his attitude toward politics in Egypt. Gamal Eid, the director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, an Egyptian human rights group, says "whoever wants to be a leader of a democratic movement should be working among them. He cannot lead a real battle against corruption and authoritarianism by remote control or Twitter. People don't forget who stood next to them and who deserted them when they were calling for democracy and fighting corruption." "My question to ElBaradei is if people started moving and taking by force their right for democracy, what is your role?" First coming When ElBaradei, the former UN nuclear chief and Noble Peace prize winner, announced in late 2009 that he was returning to settle in Egypt after decades abroad and to work to move the country toward democracy, it created political waves. Many welcomed him. Thousands of political activists from various political groups and ideologies greeted him at Cairo airport. Many of them rallied around him and formed ad hoc political coalitions supporting his cause, such as the National Association of Change. They looked at him as a potential - and maybe the only - alternative leader who could unite the country, provide a credible replacement to the ruling regime, and move the country forward toward real democracy in a critical time. They thought he offered the Egyptian opposition something it had been searching for - an internationally recognised face who could speak the language of democracy and who did not belong to any specific domestic political group. Other independent voices were more cautious. They thought ElBaradei was out of touch with the country's problems after living abroad for three decades. They feared he had little personal charisma, no grassroots in Egypt, and no experience in challenging Hosni Mubarak's powerful regime, which had been ruling the country for the last few decades, and who inherited from his predecessors a centralised state protected by gigantic security institutions. Still, the pro-government media launched a campaign to discredit him, bringing more attention and public sympathy to his efforts. First year Yet, a year after his return ElBaradei did not rise up to the challenge. He travelled abroad frequently, forcing some of his staunch supporters - such as Hassan Nafeah, a political science professor who led the NAC during its first few months - to publicly criticise ElBaradei's "absence from Egypt, which has made the change movement lose a lot of the momentum it created since he returned." In addition, ElBaradei failed to unite the opposition under his leadership before the parliamentary elections in November, when they were still divided over participating. Initially, several major parties and groups, including the liberal Wafd party and the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, decided to participate in the elections when the NAC and some other political parties boycotted it. ElBaradei also acted in a calculated and elitist way, preferring to travel overseas often and to participate in planned public campaigns and gatherings. Obviously, his approach disappointed an opposition hungry for change and activism. To his credit, ElBaradei was able to work with many opposition groups, including the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood - the largest and most organised group in the country - who were rejected not only by the ruling National Democratic Party but also by staunch secular opposition groups such as the leftist Tajamou party, who did not encourage cooperation with ElBaradei from the beginning. ElBaradei's openness to work with the Brotherhood and many others, despite strong opposition from rival opposition groups, was welcomed by many. He was also credited for his decision not to participate in the parliamentary elections, which was eventually boycotted by most of the opposition parties and groups who participated in its first round after complaints of widespread use of corruption and vote rigging. The elections ended with an overwhelming victory for the NDC and a devastating loss for the opposition, unprecedented in the last decade atleast. ElBaradei's decision not to participate in any elections under the current political and legal rules proved wise and farsighted. He has always advocated a full change of the Egyptian political system as a pre-condition for political participation. He thought that the rules of the current political game in Egypt were unfairly drawn by the ruling party which could only reproduce dictatorships, and that any participation in such a system would only give legitimacy to an authoritarian regime unwilling to change. His insistence on full change was very similar to the demands of the latest youth protests in Egypt. Last chance Despite criticisms of ElBaradei's decision return to Egypt, his announcement quickly caught attention and some enthusiasm.   George Ishaq, a former co-ordinator of Kefaya - an opposition movement that caught momentum in Egypt in the last five years - and a senior leader of NAC, says that ElBaradei "is one of the best figures in the Egyptian political arena today… a symbol of change in Egypt that Egyptians should rally around."   Ishaq thinks that ElBaradei should join the protests in the streets on Friday, called by ElBaradei a "Friday of the Martyrs", referring to those killed in the last protests. The ongoing unprecedented protest gives ElBaradei a second and rare opportunity to prove his leadership. It could be a second rare chance for ElBaradei if not the last one. To take advantage of the opportunity, ElBaradei should join the masses, show sympathy and compassion and give up his cold diplomatic image. He should give credit to the youth and the groups that have led the opposition so far and deny those who accuse them of trying to take over a movement. He should be what many Egyptians search for: a credible, respected, and unifying face for change. "ElBaradei has to stand with people, shoulder to shoulder. He should feel their victories and defeats. Then people can decide if he is a national leader and if he is up to the responsibility," says Eid.

Dr. Peggy Drexler... Tavis Smiley... Sunday Roundup Arianna Huffington This week in Davos, one of the hottest topics cutting through the cold mountain air was health care. The debate has now moved beyond how to best pay for hugely expensive interventions -- that's sick-care -- to true health care for individuals, communities, countries and our planet. At the moment, 75 percent of U.S. health care spending is on chronic, preventable diseases -- many of them related to stress. For example, diabetes now afflicts over 340 million people worldwide. That's not sustainable, so we need to redefine what we think of as successful outcomes, both in health care and in our lives. Health is our most precious natural resource. Whether it's a renewable or non-renewable resource is up to us. (You can find HuffPost Live's on-location Davos coverage here.)

Dr. Peggy Drexler... Tavis Smiley... Sunday Roundup Arianna Huffington This week in Davos, one of the hottest topics cutting through the cold mountain air was health care. The debate has now moved beyond how to best pay for hugely expensive interventions -- that's sick-care -- to true health care for individuals, communities, countries and our planet. At the moment, 75 percent of U.S. health care spending is on chronic, preventable diseases -- many of them related to stress. For example, diabetes now afflicts over 340 million people worldwide. That's not sustainable, so we need to redefine what we think of as successful outcomes, both in health care and in our lives. Health is our most precious natural resource. Whether it's a renewable or non-renewable resource is up to us. (You can find HuffPost Live's on-location Davos coverage here.) Comments featured posts 1 of 2 MMOgDMTVu6xa6IfP53NC3Q%3D%3D Why There's No Outcry Robert Reich Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond Outrage People ask me all the time why we don't have a revolution in America, or at least a major wave of reform similar to that of the Progressive Era or the New Deal or the Great Society. The answer is complex, but three reasons stand out. Comments (250) King's Legacy of Peace for Our World Bernice A. King Chief Executive Officer, The King Center On the national holiday today, The King Center is calling for a moratorium on violence. Specifically, we are asking that there be no shots fired -- no shooting off at the mouth with our tongue, no shooting off physically with our fists and no shooting off of any type of gun! Comments (11) Behind Every Great Woman Is a Great Man Anne-Marie Slaughter President and CEO, The New American Foundation Reports, panel discussions and media reports still focus overwhelmingly on measuring the participation of women in what has traditionally been the world of men. But it is equally important to measure the participation of men in what has traditionally been the world of women. Comments (76) Covering the World: Introducing The WorldPost Arianna Huffington Greetings from Davos. I'm here for the 44th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, where the theme is "The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business," and we've chosen this moment to launch The WorldPost, in partnership with the Berggruen Institute on Governance. Comments (94) Behind The Cello Yo-Yo Ma Grammy Award-Winning Cellist A new way of thinking is possible, a new consciousness -- perhaps a new Enlightenment -- that brings the arts and science back together. Comments (29) More Than Money: Put People And The Planet Alongside Profits Richard Branson Founder, Virgin Group To finally break the fossil fuel cycle that leads to warming and war, new and disruptive energy technologies (from advanced renewable fuels, to electric cars that leave their petrol-powered rivals behind, to more efficient, lower-cost solar cells and intelligent ways of heating and cooling buildings) need adequate financial backing. Comments (84) It's Time for Business to Earn a License to Lead Paul Polman CEO, Unilever Permissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it's time for business to earn a license to lead. Comments (19) Hello Class, Your Professor Is on Food Stamps Kate Quick Mother, writer, professor I was an adjunct English professor in Alaska with a baby due. If I needed to take maternity leave, it would be unpaid. But the choice that I faced -- either care for my newborn or go broke -- was never really a choice. At 27, I was a college professor on food stamps. Comments (89) Google and Apple Walter Isaacson President and CEO, Aspen Institute Innovation is wonderful, but on its own it's not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That's why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star. Comments (21) He's Justin Bieber: Or So He's Been Told Dr. Peggy Drexler Author, research psychologist and gender scholar Celebrity is a narcissistic business. Since Bieber entered the business, his career has grown at the hands of music executives who stood to make a profit on his popularity, not his mental health. Comments Achieving Global Health Equality Within a Generation Larry Summers and Gavin Yamey If we make the right investments in the health sector today, we could achieve universally low rates of infectious, maternal and child deaths by 2035. Comments What Richard Sherman Taught Us About America Isaac Saul Huffington Post's Innovation Team We're still a country that isn't ready for lower-class Americans from neighborhoods like Compton to succeed. We're still a country that can't decipher a person's character. We're still a country that can't accept someone if they're a little louder, a little prouder, a little different. Comments (1,127) Trouble for the 'Brazilian Miracle' Fernando Henrique Cardoso Former President of Brazil; Member of the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century Council Everyone sees the gap between the claims of the Brazilian miracle and the reality of daily life. People want more accountability to fix Brazil's institutions. Comments (17) Putting Women and Girls at the Center of Global Development Melinda Gates Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Over the next decade, nearly 1 billion women will enter the global workforce. This could be great for the world. If these 1 billion women are allowed to apply their ingenuity and skills and talent to their fullest extent, they will make everybody's lives better. Comments (15) Don't Bet on Coal and Oil Growth Kumi Naidoo Executive Director, Greenpeace International Even faced with weakening demand prospects, outdated investment patterns are driving fossil fuel companies to waste trillions of dollars in developing reserves and infrastructure that will be stranded as the world moves beyond 20th century energy. Comments (21) It's Time to End Child Poverty in Rich America With Urgency and Persistence Marian Wright Edelman President, Children's Defense Fund Fifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty, the United States is still not a fair playing field for millions of children afflicted by preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, poor education and violence in the world's richest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $15.7 trillion. Comments (73) The Temperance Movement and How We Beat the Tea Party Sen. Charles E. Schumer Democratic U.S. Senator from New York It's time we deal with the reality that, for the first time in American history, middle-class American incomes have declined for almost a generation. If middle-class incomes continue to decline, we will have a dramatically different America, a less optimistic, more sour America. Comments (16) Goodbye, and Good Riddance, to Superpowers in the Middle East Wadah Khanfar Journalist; President, Sharq Forum The events of the past decades have been a reflection of the interests of the superpowers and the balance of global politics. The past few years have proven that the Middle East's dependence on international powers is no longer fruitful. Comments (17) Crime Doesn't Pay? JPMorgan Chase Begs to Differ Richard (RJ) Eskow Senior Fellow, Campaign for America's Future; Host, Take Action News What do you give a Wall Street CEO who supervised a unit that lost $6 billion through incompetent and illegal trading, and whose reign of mismanagement has cost his institution $20 billion in the last year -- a figure that would've been much larger in a less morally compromised regulatory environment? If you're the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, you give him a raise. Comments To Achieve Good Health We Need Good Education Sarah Brown Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for Education Basic education and learning is too often neglected when dividing up aid and young boys and girls are held back for years - if not a lifetime - by the absence of good schooling mindful of the life skills and employment skills that will serve them well. Comments App Neutrality Should Be Part of the Net Neutrality Discussion Mark Cuban Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TV I bet you think the mobile Internet is open. That if you write the next great mobile app there is nothing that can stop it from fulfilling its destiny. That if you create a mobile content app that blows away Netflix there is nothing that can stop it. Wrong. Comments (20) Wendy Davis and the Amazing Media Mobile Home Mystery James Moore Best selling author, TV political analyst The story is true. Every damned bit of it. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth, Texas was a single mother. A teenaged mom. She lived in a mobile home. And went to Harvard. Also, she got help along the way. Can you believe it? Comments (177) WATCH: A Comedian's Hilarious Tale of Having 'The Talk' With Her Daughter TEDTalks "Ideas Worth Spreading" Having "the talk" with her 8-year-old daughter was awkward enough. Then they decided to look up cats mating on the Internet, and soon actress and author Julia Sweeney was an inch away from showing her daughter porn. Don't miss the hilarious (and heartwarming) results. Comments The WorldPost: A Platform For Global Conversation Peter S. Goodman Executive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington Post The WorldPost is a product of the idea that the most foundational challenges of our era, from the perils of climate change to the epidemic of youth unemployment, can neither be understood nor addressed through the traditional frame of the nation state, but require collective efforts spanning geography and cultures. Comments The Questions That Will Save Your Relationships Glennon Melton Blogger, Momastery If we don't want throwaway answers, we can't ask throwaway questions. A caring question is a key that will unlock a room inside the person you love. Comments (36) UNESCO and the Jews: Shame Bernard-Henri Lévy French philosopher and writer UNESCO has long had on its schedule an exhibit titled "People, Book, Land: The 3,500-Year Relationship of the Jewish People with the Holy Land." The content of the exhibit had been approved by archaeological experts and met all pertinent scientific criteria. But less than a week from its opening, the exhibit was suddenly put on hold. Comments (26) Clearing the Air Scarlett Johansson Actress While I never intended on being the face of any social or political movement, distinction, separation or stance as part of my affiliation with SodaStream, given the amount of noise surrounding that decision, I'd like to clear the air.

(20140127,thevoiceofreason10.tumblr.com,http://thevoiceofreason10.tumblr.com/post/4501273644/hobbes-or-locke-an-egyptian-revolution?route=%2Fpost%2F%3Aid%2F%3Asummary,The Voice of Reason - Hobbes or Locke: An Egyptian Revolution The Voice of Reason Apr 10 Hobbes or Locke: An Egyptian Revolution After the uprising in Tunisia in December 2010 and the expulsion of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011 after 23 years in power, tensions in Egypt began to mount towards the end of January. This tension originated from the actions of the Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt since 1981: a fraudulent election in December 2010 in which Mubarak was once again declared the winner, and Mubarak’s clear intensions to pass on power to his son led to the eruption of protests in Cairo on January 25th, only eleven days after the protests in Tunisia. After 30 years in power, on February 11th, after 18 days of protest, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to his newly instated vice-president. In this act, Mubarak’s rule over Egypt was ended, and a new democratic system was instated that ended the reign of tyranny over Egypt. Or so the media would have you think. However, the route cause of this ‘revolution’ needs to be examined in order to determine whether the ousting of Mubarak was an example of Thomas Hobbes’s state, or a John Locke state, as the implications of this will be far reaching, and imperative to the future of Egypt. Whether or not this was an example of Hobbes or Locke is determined by one’s view of the true nature of humans. In this grassroots project, encouraged by the use of social media caused video blogs to go viral at a time when emotions were highly charged in Egypt. The accessibility of these videos led to the protests in Tahrir square, where tens of thousands protested for the removal of Mubarak as president. This is a clear example of the state of nature that Hobbes described in his Leviathan, as “all mankind [has] a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceases only in death”. The actions exhibited by the Egyptian people are a clear example of this, at the beginning of the eighteen days, they were not demanding the resignation of Mubarak, but of the Interior Minister. It was only once Mubarak changed his cabinet on January 28th that the people realized the power they had, and decided to go for more. In that politically and emotionally charged environment, they reverted back to their natural state, seeking only one power after another, until February 18th when Mubarak resigned and they had no one left to target. Or so the Hobbes perspective would have you believe. However, if you look at the manner in which the revolution came about, it is clear that this is an example of Locke. The protesters revolted against five main issues: unfair elections and lack of freedom of speech, passing on of Mubarak’s power to his son, police brutality, state of emergency laws and economic issues (including high unemployment, food price inflation and low minimum wages). This is a clear example of the State of Nature, along with the Law of Nature that governs it that was described in Two Treaties of Government; “Law teaches all Mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his Life, Health, Liberty or Possessions.” This is what the Egyptian revolution was based on, as they demanded the government to uphold their freedoms and equality, and when that failed, they instituted their right to revolution and ousted their president. So if it is accepted that Egypt is an example of a Locke’s world, what is the implication of that on Canada? In their statement on Canada’s role in Egypt, the government stated that “Egypt remains an important partner for Canada, and we urge the Egyptian government to ensure full freedom of political expression for its citizens.” [1] Although at first glance it appears that the Canadian government is exhibiting a Locke standpoint, it is clearly a Hobbes agenda. This emphasis on a Hobbes state comes from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; the first point of the Charter states that “the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” This is a very realist view exhibited by Hobbes. According to Locke, rights and freedoms are inalienable and can never be denied to a citizen of a country. The rights are not subject to ‘reasonable limits’ that can thus be denied when it suits someone. Thus, it is not only the basis that the government is acting on, but also the actions of the government itself that uses the rhetoric of liberalism, but is in fact realist. In this way, the government feels that they have no responsibility to the people of Egypt who are trying to conduct a revolution, and thus act accordingly. I believe that it is the right and responsibility of the Canadian government to aid the people of Egypt in this clear example of the right to revolution described by Locke. Ultimately, if this were an example of a ‘Hobbesian’ world, the Egyptian people would have submitted themselves to a new power in order to maintain the peace. However, they were under the rule of a dictator for thirty years who was difficult to challenge, yet they still revolted. In this ‘Lockean’ world, it is clear that people are just exercising their right to revolution at a time when they are being suppressed by their government, as “Tyranny is the exercise of Power beyond Right.” Thus, they have exercised their right, and have ousted Mubarak. As of yet, it has been a month since the removal of Mubarak as leader of the country, and a lot has yet to be seen as to the fate of Egypt. However, one thing has been made clear: if another leader of Egypt dares to treat the Egyptians in the same way as Mubarak, they should watch out as the people know how to institute their right to revolution.

Say it on the Huffington Post featured blog posts Presented By IBM The Cloud: A Holiday Shopping Miracle Jill Puleri Global Industry Leader, Retail Global Services, IBM If Santa and his merry band of elves were real, it would take about 50 international distribution centers to re-stock his sleigh to deliver presents to millions of children around the world.  Comments     Presented By IBM How 'Ninjas' Are Fighting Superbugs Bob Allen "Ninjas" are coming to the rescue in the fight against superbugs. It's the kind of attack that this frightening wave of new bugs can't adapt to -- unlike antibiotics. Comments How Melbourne Is Fast-Tracking Smart Transit Using Big Data Deepak Advani General Manager of IBM Cloud and Smarter Infrastructure Today's public transportation systems are becoming simply too big, complex, and popular for humans to maintain. Maintaining this infrastructure is a complex task that's only becoming more complicated with the steady increase in population and the rise of megacities. But we are finding that our greatest assets in tackling these challenges are data and smarter infrastructure software. With sensors and mobile technology, we can finally create the smart networks we need to understand these ever-changing systems. Comments Saving Lives From Afar: Bridging The Knowledge (& Distance) Gaps In Health Care With The Cloud Jeffrey Burns, MD It was a child who nearly died that made me realize just how drastically my profession had to change. Because nearly 8 million children died in 2010 before reaching the age of five, in large part because of imminently treatable illnesses, and because 57 countries globally are facing a human resources health crisis and of those countries, each only has 1.13 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 13.22 per 1,000 in the U.S. Comments BYOD to School? 5 Tips for Keeping Student Devices Secure Caleb Barlow Whether in junior high or in college, many students have one thing in common: a smartphone or tablet is in their pocket or backpack. According to eMarketer, by the end of 2013, smartphone users will represent over half of all mobile phone users. And by 2016, nearly three in five Americans will have a smartphone, including students. Comments   Innovation Earth: Is Zeoform The Plastic Of The Future? Jennifer Grayson Environmental journalist and Innovation Earth columnist I'm outside on a Sunday afternoon writing this column, so ostensibly I should be enjoying the cloudless blue sky and soft breeze as it whispers throug... Comments PRESENTED BY IBM Rejecting 'The Expected': One Woman Engineer's Story Stefanie Chiras, PhD When I was growing up in Massachusetts, my Dad loved to work on cars. Every time he headed out to the driveway, I was right there with him. One weekend, when I was 10 or so, he told me we were off to fix a transmission. "I can't do that," I said. He replied without a pause, "People do it every day. You can certainly do it once." That straightforward advice -- and the fact that we did fix the transmission -- stuck with me. Comments Millennials Make Cities A Better Place To Live -- For Everyone Katharine Frase CTO, IBM Global Public Sector This is the era of the city. It is also the era of the Millennial. With a growing population of bright, diverse, wired and connected young people who really care about where they live, the two are ideal for each other, but our cities must keep up in attracting the prized demographic. Comments (28) Improving Your Commute, One (Smarter) City At A Time Naveen Lamba Associate Partner, Smarter Government, Transportation, and Public Safety, IBM Global Business Services Whether you live in Northern Virginia like me, New York, Nairobi, or Nice, road congestion and the ensuing traffic jams aren't just inconvenient; they can impede economic growth and impact the environment. Imagine how much more productive people are when they're not stuck in their cars or on the bus several hours per day. The good news is that help is on the way. Comments (17) My Year Using Aereo: How A Dime-Sized Antenna Met My TV Needs Gerry Smith Technology reporter, The Huffington Post If you're a light TV viewer who just wants to watch the major networks, Aereo might be right for you. Comments (792) A Marketplace for Stronger Connections Between Neurons John Pavley CTO @ The Huffington Post, Blogger NextLesson is a web app where teachers and parents can get access to pre-designed lesson plans or create their own. It wasn't created by a 20-year-old to jump on the next big trend. It was created by a couple of dads using the ideas and techniques of high tech to solve a real problem in education. Comments (29) Heat Wave Psychology: Long Past, Green Future? Wray Herbert Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Countries vary dramatically in their records of environmental responsibility. Clearly there are economic and political reasons for these stark differences, but is it also possible that human psychology plays a role in creating collective pro-environmental mindsets? Comments (16) Presented by IBM How To Prevent Hunger In Upcoming Decades? Try Precision Agriculture Lloyd A. Treinish Chief Scientist, Deep Thunder, IBM Research How many mouths will the world be feeding by 2050? It is an estimated 9.2 billion, up from 7 billion today. To keep pace with this growing population, global food production will need to increase by 70 percent. That means getting a lot smarter about how we raise crops. Comments (79) Why Mobile Matters in the 'Era of You' Kristen Lauria Vice President of Marketing, IBM Mobile Enterprise for IBM's Software Group While mobile computing is becoming the darling of marketers, its explosive growth rate is rather daunting, with more customers shopping via mobile devices every day. Forrester Research anticipates mobile commerce will exceed $31 billion by 2016. And by 2020 there will be 10 billion-plus devices in the pockets and palms of consumers. Comments Smaller Cities Engage Citizens Through Small Business Innovation Katharine Frase CTO, IBM Global Public Sector People say they'd like to influence or actively participate in their local government. In fact, according to a Civic Plus Digital Citizen Engagement survey, nearly half of those polled want to provide input in their municipal government. But turning this interest into action is one of the biggest roadblocks to implementing local community ideas. How can local municipalities tap into the increasing power of social and mobile technologies to create a community of active influencers? Comments We Don't Need to Sugarcoat the Cure for Climate Change Kelly Rigg Executive Director, GCCA Here's a question I bet no one has ever asked before: What do Mary Poppins and the International Energy Agency have in common? Answer: Both like to dish out their medicine with a spoonful of sugar. Comments (36) KABOOM!

Listening Post Last updated: 25 Jan 2014 11:25 In recent weeks, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has been caught up in a corruption scandal. And the media - more than just reporting the story - has become an interesting sub-plot in it. Turkey has a poor record on media freedom, not helped by the number of conglomerates that own media outlets which tend not to criticise the government. But the scandal has prompted a change in direction; the media criticism of Erdogan has been sharp, and the instruments the government is coming back at them with are blunt. Turkey's government has made allegations that the critical media are part of a conspiracy involving foreign powers who want a new government in Ankara. And all of this is unfolding against the backdrop of upcoming elections, in which the media - and their ability to cover the vote - will be a crucial part of the democratic process.  On this week’s News Bytes: The Pakistan Taliban claim responsibility for the murder of three media workers employed at a critical news outlet; Twitter suspends the accounts of the military wing of Hamas; and a veteran Egyptian correspondent backtracks after calling for the slaughter of Americans on live television. Washington's revolving door Journalists in Washington are supposed to know what is happening in the corridors of power. Then there are those who walk the corridors themselves, quitting a job in the media to work in politics. But it is a revolving door and there have also been a number of politicians who have moved into the media. Since President Barack Obama took office, a record number of journalists, at least 16, have taken up jobs in his administration. But politicians, and the reporters who cover them, are supposed to have an adversarial relationship. So what is at stake when the line between politics and journalism becomes blurred? In this week’s feature, the Listening Post’s Gouri Sharma looks at the implications of the revolving door between the media and politics in Washington. Finally, this week's web video features something slightly different. Rino Stefano Tagliafierro is an Italian animator who takes old paintings - masterpieces - by artists like Michelangelo and Rubens and digitally adds movement to them. His edited collection reflects the cycle of life, all the way through to death. With more than 100 000 hits online, "Beauty" is our web video of the week.

Yan Seiler Last updated: 26 Jan 2014 12:30 It is perhaps one of the world's most misunderstood infectious diseases. Believed by many to be both incurable and highly contagious, leprosy is, in fact, neither. If caught and treated early enough, disability can be averted. But if left untreated, it can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 14 million leprosy patients have been cured in the past 20 years and four million since 2000. But it has proved harder to eradicate the social stigma surrounding the disease. Many of those with the disease are shunned by their families and communities, and are forced to make a meagre living by begging. Some, in countries such as India where the disease remains endemic, move into colonies, where they construct homes from discarded scraps and often live out their lives with little contact with the families they left behind. Janardan Yadaz was diagnosed with leprosy in 1978 and moved into the Ashapur colony in India. He has only been home once in the past 30 years. He says: "Ashapur is my home, my heart lies here."  View As One Page >> View As Slideshow >> /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera The entrance to the Ashapur leprosy colony. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera Residents often build their own homes in the colony. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera A resident of the Ashapur colony offers his morning prayers. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera This resident of the colony lives there with her 55-year-old mother. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera A resident with her breakfast. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera Shyam Narayan Singh, 65, has lived at Ashapur for 16 years. /Yan Seiler/Al Jazeera After being diagnosed with leprosy in 1978, Ashapur resident Janardan Yadaz, says he made a living by begging at 'ghats' or holy places, along the Ganges River.

Al Jazeera Last updated: 25 Jan 2014 09:50 Cairo, Egypt - Vivien Magdy was a young girl in her early twenties when her fiancé was crushed beneath the wheels of a rampaging armoured personnel carrier. Her husband-to-be, Maikel Mossad, had been among thousands of mainly Coptic Christian demonstrators who marched to Downtown Cairo in October 2011 following a row over church-building rights. In what became known by activists as the notorious Maspero Massacre - named after the state TV headquarters around which the demonstrators converged - 28 protesters lost their lives when the rally was attacked by troops and police. The killings formed one of the grim chapters of Egypt’s transition following the revolt of January 2011; a day which began with Egyptians exercising their newfound voice of protest against the state, but ended with yet more blood and tears splattered on the floors of the city morgues. On Saturday, three years after the insurrection which was beamed into the living rooms of astonished viewers around the globe, Egypt is again convulsed by violence and political discord. The capital was shaken by a series of deadly bombings which killed several people on Friday. There was another explosion near a police academy Saturday morning, according to security officials, though nobody was injured. Meanwhile the government is engaged in a transitional "roadmap" towards elections expected this year – a divisive process which is welcomed by its many supporters, but emphatically rejected by allies of the toppled President Mohamed Morsi. 'Biggest cause' As Egyptians prepare to mark the anniversary of their role in the Arab Uprisings, Al Jazeera spoke to relatives and friends of those who have perished since January 2011 to ask them how they felt about where the country is now. Some of the interviewees asked that pseudonyms be used in this article. They were not comfortable speaking publicly to Al Jazeera, an organisation which has become unpopular with some sectors of Egypt's population following last summer’s coup. Spotlight Follow our ongoing coverage of the political crisis in Egypt Magdy, a 25-year-old who works for a Cairo-based NGO, has perhaps every reason to feel embittered about the status quo. In her own words, the Maspero Massacre remains "the biggest cause", because it was the first time many activists came to the conclusion that the "army was not with the people" – despite the fact that Egypt was then being governed by a military council which had assumed power following the downfall of Honsi Mubarak. "The biggest disgrace of the army was Maspero," she said. And yet Magdy says she believes the death of her fiancé Maikel, 25, was "worth it". "He was presented as a gift in order that Egypt might be improved," she said. "In order that the country becomes better for people to live in a more comfortable way, and for freedom and social justice to exist. "I’m confident that what we did was worth it," she added. 'Easy people to rule' In Alaa al-Aswany’s novel, The Yacoubian Building, an official from the fictional Patriotic Party - based on Mubarak’s former ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) - describes how "the Egyptians are the easiest people in the world to rule". "Any party in Egypt," says the man, "when it makes elections and is in power, is bound to win, because the Egyptian is bound to support the government. It’s just the way God made him." The passage – written by an author who has expressed vehement support for the current military-backed government – is an acerbic swipe against the corrupt entitlements of Mubarak-era rule. Magdy does not agree that the Egyptian people will never again be willing to challenge their rulers. But she does believe that another revolt is not possible for the time being. "The Egyptian people want a pharaoh," she added, referring to the huge levels of public support for General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s army chief. "They didn’t understand that freedom wasn’t just sitting in Tahrir Square for 18 days. No, freedom takes years." New violence Following the massive car bomb on Friday outside Cairo’s police headquarters, a large crowd of civilians began to gather in front of the shattered building. Some chanted for the "execution of the Muslim Brotherhood", others waved pictures of General al-Sisi in variety of authoritative poses. One street seller sold posters declaring supporters of toppled President Mohamed Morsi to be the "dogs of the people". Whoever carried out the attack - Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, the al-Qaida linked group based in North Sinai, has claimed responsibility - it is likely to play into the hands of regime hawks who want to tighten the grip of the military and security establishment. After spending half a year engaged in a merciless crackdown against the country’s religious parties and groups, the state has been busily hunting for new enemies. Yesterday the film-maker Aalam Wassef was arrested after police raided his home. An American translator, Jeremy Hodge, was detained earlier this week along with film-maker Hossam Meneai, and is currently being held without charge. It comes after a recent period in which several Egyptian and international journalists have been arrested, secular politicians have found themselves faced with criminal charges, and leading youth activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising have been handed jail sentences for contravening a new anti-protest law. Military legitimacy But despite criticism from rights groups and Western officials, there is considerable domestic support for the government’s appropriation of iron fist politics after three years of chaos and uncertainty. Ahmed Sayed lost his son during the clashes which erupted between protesters and the security services outside the headquarters of the Egyptian cabinet in Downtown Cairo in December 2011. But the leaders of this coup want to either control us or kill us. If we don’t go to the streets then they will kill us anyway. Sherif Abdullah, demonstrator  Despite saying he believes the army should be held "fully accountable" for the blood spilled during the 18 month rule of the military council, he is supportive of the current government and its transitional "roadmap" towards elections. Speaking to Al Jazeera International in a Downtown Cairo café, he carried with him a placard featuring a photo of his 20-year-old son alongside the words "congratulations, oh martyrs, for the success of the revolution". "I opposed Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood," said Sayed. "The military is the only institution that can save us from that group. "The army only took over because that was the demand of the people," he added, referring to the protests last summer which culminated in the toppling of Mohamed Morsi. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Sherif Abdullah is less keen to forgive Egypt’s current rulers. One of his best friends, Tariq Nour, was shot dead during the massacre at Rabaa al-Adawiya last August - the worst single act of mass killing in Egypt’s modern history. Like many of those who were present that day in the pro-Morsi encampment, he continues to reject the popular coup which led to the Islamist ruler’s downfall. "The government doesn’t want a political solution," he said. "They want a security solution. All they want is to kill, kill and kill." Nevertheless, he said that the death of Tariq, a 39-year-old father-of-three from Kafr el-Sheikh in northern Egypt, was not in vain. "The death of my friend was hard," he said. "But the leaders of this coup want to either control us or kill us. "If we don’t go to the streets then they will kill us anyway." 1262 Source: Al Jazeera Topics in this article People Vivien Magdy Ahmed Sayed Honsi Mubarak Mohamed Morsi Maikel Mossad Aalam Wassef Tariq Nour Abdel Fattah al-Sisi Jeremy Hodge Hossam Meneai Fattah al-Sisi Country Egypt City Cairo North Sinai Organisation army National Democratic Party Muslim Brotherhood al-Qaeda Patriotic Party Mossad Featured on Al Jazeera Al-Qaeda slaughters on Syria's killing fields More than 1,000 Syrians flee al-Qaeda-linked group as they mow down children and behead prisoners in cold blood.

Ilham Rawoot Last updated: 24 Jan 2014 17:08 Johannesburg, South Africa - It has been almost two years since 27-year-old Pinky Mosiane was raped and murdered hundreds of metres underground in an Anglo Platinum mineshaft in Marikana, South Africa. A suspect in the Mosiane case was finally arrested three months ago. This was not the first time a woman mineworker had been raped underground in South Africa. But it was the first time that substantial attention was given to these women and the sexual harassment they are subjected to on a daily basis.  In August 2012, a mining town named Marikana, along the "Platinum Belt" in South Africa's North West province, made headlines  around the globe. Thirty-four mineworkers employed by platinum miner Lonmin were killed when police opened fire during a strike over wages. SPECIAL SERIES: MINING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - Tanzania's gold rush and housing crush - Silicosis: The curse of Lesotho's miners - Mozambique fishermen decry gas drilling - Arandis: The uranium capital of the world - Mining while female: The perils of Marikana But the women of Lonmin have often remained unnoticed. "Anne", a miner employed by Lonmin in Marikana who asked that her real name not be used, has been working underground for three years fixing ventilation pipes. With her gold-painted nails and not a stray hair amid her tight braids, it is hard to imagine her labouring in overalls, covered in black dust.  "After [the end of the work day] at midday, we have to wait till 3:30pm in the waiting area for the lift to take us back to the surface," she says. "Some days, it was me alone with 12 men." She says there have been days where there have been five women left in the waiting area with as many as 65 men. Because many mining companies either do not meet the 10 percent quota of female employees required by the South African Mining Charter, or stick to the minimum, there are often very few women on a shift with dozens of men. Just eight percent of Lonmin employees are women.  Few female miners Sue Vey, a spokesperson for Lonmin, said that while the company has not met the 10 percent quota, it was planning "to achieve this milestone". Just over five percent of the company's female employees work underground. She says the mine does not consider the ratio of men to women allocated to a shift, instead appointing them based on the requirements of the roles.  There are only two toilets in the section... It's so far to walk and it's dark, dark, dark. Even if you scream, no-one is going to hear you. - "Anne," female miner "Eish, how many women were raped underground?" Anne asks rhetorically, shaking her head. She says that if a woman were to be raped, she would not report it to an authority figure, for fear of losing her job. "There are only two toilets in the section. One for men and one for women. For 70 workers. But it's so far to walk and it's dark, dark, dark. Even if you scream, no-one is going to hear you."  Tiny Magija, the coordinator of the Justice for Pinky Mosiane Campaign, says that while companies are aware of the issue of sexual abuse and harassment underground, they are not doing much about it.  "Research has shown that gender-based violence in mining is very rife," she says. "The quota has always been there, but it hasn't been implemented and no-one is voicing an opinion about it, till it's at the point where abuse is happening every day. Women in the mining industry are seen as sex objects."  She says a major part of the problem is that "the people in the positions of power are the same people oppressing women. Look at Pinky: The man arrested was an occupational health safety officer. The companies don't care about sexually based violence. If they did, then why is it taking them so long to actually do anything?" When asked about complaints, Lonmin's Vey said there had been no reported cases of rape at the company, and that it had sexual harassment policies and procedures, and kept employees informed of what to do in such situations through extensive communication campaigns.  Claims of harassment Gender-based abuse underground goes beyond the obviously violent, say female miners at the company, who claim they have to sell their bodies to climb the ranks, or to have their complaints taken seriously.  "If you want something at work, you have to love the supervisor or chibaas [chief boss] or the kaptein [captain]," said Anne. "It's hard to get a promotion, because guys take advantage - they just say 'love me'."  Alternatively, she says she could pay a bribe, also known as a "chocho", for as much as 5,000 South African rand ($470), to her captain. She says that she cannot talk to the staff in the human resources department as "they are all men".  Safety of all our employees is critical and therefore we take a dim view to any acts of harassment. - Sue Vey, Lonmin spokesperson "Connie", who also asked that her real name not be used, broke her leg while on shift underground at Lonmin in 2008, and has since left the company. But even then, said the 35-year-old, the problems were the same. When she applied for a job, she was asked for sex a few times, but refused. "Women are treated very unfairly in this job," she said. "If you want a better position, you have to bribe or sleep with the bosses, even the ones in HR. Women who won't do it, who try to stand their ground, get dismissed." She said women are considered powerless by their male co-workers. "Lonmin has a budget for women, but their employees are trying to destroy our dignity. They just use us." Vey said that "these are certainly very serious allegations. Safety of all our employees is critical and therefore we take a dim view to any acts of harassment". She said that the company had "human resources staff deployed across the business who are trained to assist employees with social and workplace issues" and an anonymous tip-off line that employees could use to report cases of harassment. "We also have an extensive Employee Wellness Programme that could be used. We also have Women in Mining structures across the business, run by women."  But female miners say almost every aspect of their work involves some kind of harassment. In the lifts between the surface and the shaft, women are squashed between men's bodies; they are insulted for being less powerful physically. 'Part of underground culture' Asanda Benya is a sociologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, who spent time working underground as part of her research. "To a huge degree, harassment has been normalised, so that's one of the ways they deal with it - they accept it as part of underground culture. I think to some degree the companies are are aware of it, but not at the true scale. At the same time, they are in denial about it, or also see it as normal 'mining men' behaviour." She said that while women do complain, "most times the HR officer is friends with the accused and the case is never really followed through, or women are told 'it's not harassment, they are appreciating you - that's how it is in mining'. At other times, the women are afraid to report [attacks] because they don't want to lose their jobs or be alienated by other workers."  Yet even considering the risks involved, the high unemployment rate for women in Marikana means that a job in the mines is something to aspire to.  "Women have no choice but to do this work," said Anne. "Life is difficult. Who can help you? I don't know. There is no-one to tell about my problems. And I can't trust anyone: You never know who is good and who is wrong."

ElBaradei touched down in Cairo Friday evening for the first time since leaving his post as head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Association after 12 years in office. Supporters hope to use the publicity to boost speculation about his potential candidacy for 2011 elections. Egypt has been ruled for nearly 30 years by Hosni Mubarak, who appears to be trying to set up a political dynasty by grooming his son to succeed him. Respected worldwide and untouched by the corruption tainting much of Egypt's current regime, ElBaradei, who won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, could be the most credible opposition leader to emerge as this U.S.-allied country prepares for 2011 presidential elections. And many Egyptians hope ElBaradei's international standing will make it difficult for the current government to persecute him for trying to bring reform to the country. The crowd at the airport – made up of actors, intellectuals, opposition leaders, and regular Egyptians – broke into loud applause when word of ElBaradei's arrival spread, and then sang the Egyptian national anthem. Many supporters carried large posters with ElBaradei's face and the word "YES!" signifying their desire to see him run for president. Bloggers and activists followed his arrival with a live stream on the Internet of what was happening on the ground at the airport. ElBaradei tried to leave the VIP lounge at the airport shortly after his arrival, but the sheer size of the crowd blocked the exit of the lounge and prevented him. He was briefly glimpsed getting into a car and driving off, waving to his supporters through the car window. Despite the enthusiasm his return has sparked among many Egyptians hungry for change, ElBaradei has been guarded about a potential presidential run. In an open letter responding to an effort by young Egyptians urging him to run for president, he said he would only join the race if guaranteed that elections would be free, fully supervised by the judiciary and monitored by the international community. He also wants the constitution amended to remove restrictions on who is eligible to run.

ElBaradei touched down in Cairo Friday evening for the first time since leaving his post as head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Association after 12 years in office. Supporters hope to use the publicity to boost speculation about his potential candidacy for 2011 elections. Egypt has been ruled for nearly 30 years by Hosni Mubarak, who appears to be trying to set up a political dynasty by grooming his son to succeed him. Respected worldwide and untouched by the corruption tainting much of Egypt's current regime, ElBaradei, who won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, could be the most credible opposition leader to emerge as this U.S.-allied country prepares for 2011 presidential elections. And many Egyptians hope ElBaradei's international standing will make it difficult for the current government to persecute him for trying to bring reform to the country. The crowd at the airport – made up of actors, intellectuals, opposition leaders, and regular Egyptians – broke into loud applause when word of ElBaradei's arrival spread, and then sang the Egyptian national anthem. Many supporters carried large posters with ElBaradei's face and the word "YES!" signifying their desire to see him run for president. Bloggers and activists followed his arrival with a live stream on the Internet of what was happening on the ground at the airport. ElBaradei tried to leave the VIP lounge at the airport shortly after his arrival, but the sheer size of the crowd blocked the exit of the lounge and prevented him. He was briefly glimpsed getting into a car and driving off, waving to his supporters through the car window. Despite the enthusiasm his return has sparked among many Egyptians hungry for change, ElBaradei has been guarded about a potential presidential run. In an open letter responding to an effort by young Egyptians urging him to run for president, he said he would only join the race if guaranteed that elections would be free, fully supervised by the judiciary and monitored by the international community. He also wants the constitution amended to remove restrictions on who is eligible to run.
